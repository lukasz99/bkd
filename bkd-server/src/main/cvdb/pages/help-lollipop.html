<h2>Lollipop Help: Variant Selection</h2>
</hr>

<p>Select a transcript using the drop down menu on the top left.
<ul>
  <li>Amino acid numbering will reflect the selected transcript.</li>
</ul>
<p>Select a database to search using the check boxes on the top right. This
  determines the source for the variants shown in the graph below.
<ul>
  <li>Options: ClinVar, dbSNP, or CVDB reports.</li>
  <li>Can select one or more source at the same time.</li>
</ul>

<p>The lollipops show the variants reported in the database selected.
<ul>
  <li>If different amino acid changes are reported at the same position, they
    will be included in the same lollipop.</li>
  <li>Height of the lollipop/the number displayed reflect the number of variants
    at that position. </li>
</ul
<p>Click on a lollipop to see details about variants reported at a specific
  position in the specified database.
<ul>
  <li>It is possible to select more than one lollipop at the same time.</li>
  <li>This will display the different amino acid changes reported at this
    position, with links to ClinGen, ClinVar, dbSNP, and gnomAD if available</li>
  <li>If there is a link in the “CVDB” column, that means this variant also
    contains an entry in the CVDB database.</li>
  <li>Click on the lollipop again to de-select.</li>
</ul>
<p>Zoom in to a specific region of the protein using the grey slider bars
  at the bottom of the graph.
