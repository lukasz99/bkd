<h2>Lollipop Panel Help</h2>
</hr>

<p>The lollipops show the variants reported in the database selected.
<ul>
  <li>If different amino acid changes are reported at the same position, they
    will be included in the same lollipop.</li>
  <li>Height of the lollipop/the number displayed reflect the number of variants
    at that position. </li>
</ul
<p>Click on a lollipop to see details about variants reported at a specific
  position in the specified database.
<ul>
  <li>It is possible to select more than one lollipop at the same time.</li>
  <li>This will display the different amino acid changes reported at this
    position, with links to ClinGen, ClinVar, dbSNP, and gnomAD if available</li>
  <li>If there is a link in the <em>CVDB</em> column, that means this variant also
    contains an entry in the CVDB database.</li>
  <li>Click on the lollipop again to de-select.</li>
</ul>
